//! Attention items — things that want a human (yggdrasil-130).
//!
//! Three categories surface in the attention pane / tab badge:
//!
//!   1. agents in `waiting_tool` / hung > N min — the user owes them a
//!      Yes/No on a tool call;
//!   2. runs that are `awaiting_review` (approval gate, ADR 0016 §D8);
//!   3. runs that have been auto-nudged ≥ 2 times — likely stuck in
//!      a loop the scheduler can't break.
//!
//! The pane's value-prop is: instead of scanning four other panes for
//! "anything I need to do", this tab is the punch list. The numeric
//! badge on the tab title = sum of the three counts.
