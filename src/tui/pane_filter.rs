//! Per-pane filter state (yggdrasil-128). Each pane carries a
//! `PaneFilter` that owns a `tui-input::Input` for the pattern + a
//! mode flag; pressing `/` enters edit mode, typing builds the
//! pattern, Enter commits, Esc clears.
//!
//! The pane-level integration (handing keys to `Input` while in edit
//! mode, applying `matches` to its rows) is per-pane work that lands
//! incrementally. This module ships:
//!
//! - the state machine (`enter`, `cancel`, `commit`, `clear`, `mode`),
//! - the `matches(haystack)` predicate panes call per row,
//! - the `compose` helper that joins the pattern with optional pane
//!   scope tags so future composability ("status:open priority:0") can
//!   layer in.
