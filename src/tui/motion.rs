//! Motion vocabulary for the TUI (yggdrasil-165 + yggdrasil-169).
//!
//! Four named primitives, each with a fixed semantic role; mixing them
//! arbitrarily produces noise, so future panes are expected to pick the
//! one that matches the event class:
//!
//! | Primitive | Frames | Use for                          |
//! |-----------|--------|----------------------------------|
//! | flash     | 1      | discrete state transition         |
//! | pulse     | 3      | milestone / completion            |
//! | ripple    | N      | cascade across rows (yggdrasil-166) |
//! | slide     | 2      | row arrival / departure           |
//!
//! Plus two **continuous** primitives that don't fit the discrete
//! taxonomy but solve the "frozen screen" feel without stealing data:
//!
//! - **breathing**: sine-wave opacity (intensity) for the dot indicator
//!   on active agents. Idle agents stay solid so motion = signal.
//! - **sparkline tail**: a 1-cell-tall braille glyph that scrolls left
//!   on each refresh tick — visible heartbeat of the pane.
//!
//! The Stardew/Vampire-Survivors anti-patterns (color-cycling borders,
//! decorative spinners, animations longer than 500ms) live in the test
//! file as documented "do not regress" guards.
