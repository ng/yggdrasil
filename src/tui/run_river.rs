//! Run river — per-agent token horizon chart (yggdrasil-159).
//!
//! Tufte's horizon chart applied to LLM cost: stack each agent's
//! token-spend trace into 2 lines × N columns of half-block glyphs.
//! Coincident spikes across agents read as a synchronised storm; idle
//! troughs as ambient quiet. The single visual where "where did the
//! day's tokens go?" answers itself at a glance.
//!
//! Substrate first: this module ships the half-cosine-band folding
//! math + the glyph picker. The Postgres query (rolling per-minute
//! token rate per agent) and the pane render layer compose on top.

/// One sample (per minute) of an agent's token rate.
