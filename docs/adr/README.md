# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds the non-obvious architectural choices behind Yggdrasil, in the [Markdown Any Decision Records (MADR)](https://adr.github.io/madr/) style. Each record captures the context, the decision, and the consequences — especially the ones we'll regret if we forget.

ADRs are append-only. Superseded decisions get a new ADR that references the old one; the old file stays in place for provenance.

## Writing a new ADR

1. Copy the most recent ADR as a template.
2. Number sequentially (zero-padded to four digits).
3. Keep it short — one page is the target. If it needs to be longer, the decision probably isn't crisp yet.
4. State the alternatives you rejected and *why*. Future-you needs to know what you considered, not just what you picked.
5. Link from this index.
