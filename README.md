# Yggdrasil

Yggdrasil is a multi-agent coordination layer for AI coding agents. It gives fleets of Claude Code instances (or any CLI-driven agent) the infrastructure they need to work in the same codebase without colliding: resource locking, task tracking with dependency graphs, a scheduler for autonomous task execution, a real-time TUI dashboard, and inter-agent messaging. Built in Rust, backed by PostgreSQL. The CLI binary is `ygg`.

> **Note (ADR 0015, 2026-06-07):** Yggdrasil started as both a coordination layer *and* a similarity-retrieved cross-session memory. The memory bet didn't pay off, so the embedding/retrieval layer (Ollama, pgvector, the `nodes` DAG, scoped memories, per-turn injection) was removed. Yggdrasil is now a focused **orchestration** layer. Durable agent rules live in Claude Code's native `CLAUDE.md` / `MEMORY.md`.

## Install

**From source** (requires Rust 1.75+):

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

**From GitHub releases:** coming soon.

**Homebrew:** coming soon.

## Requirements

- **Rust 1.75+** (build from source only)
- **PostgreSQL 14+**

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Bootstrap everything: Postgres check, migrations, hooks
ygg init

# 2. Create a task
ygg task create "my first task" --kind task --priority 2

# 3. Spawn a Claude Code agent to work on it
ygg spawn --task "do something"

# 4. Open the TUI dashboard to watch your fleet
ygg dashboard

# 5. Check fleet state from the command line
ygg status
```

```

Hooks (installed by `ygg init` as native `ygg hook <event>` handlers) fire at Claude Code lifecycle events:

- **SessionStart / PreCompact** -> `ygg prime` -- emits agent context as markdown
- **UserPromptSubmit** -> delivers unread agent-to-agent messages, records token stats
- **Stop** -> `ygg run capture-outcome` + `ygg stop-check` -- records task-run outcome, blocks premature worker exit
- **PreToolUse** -> `ygg lock` / `ygg agent-tool` -- enforces resource leases, records tool usage

There is no long-running daemon other than the optional `ygg watcher` (heartbeats, lock expiry) and the `ygg scheduler`. Everything else runs as one-shot CLI invocations.

## Why Yggdrasil Exists

Running one agent in a terminal is easy. Running three to seven is taxing but common. Beyond that, things break: too many windows to watch, too much overlap on shared files, too much context lost to compaction, too much prior conversation that never resurfaces.

Yggdrasil focuses on the parts that are hard to get in one place:

- A shared **lock graph** so agents don't clobber each other mid-edit.
- **Task tracking** with a dependency DAG, epic rollups, and a scheduler that dispatches ready tasks to spawned agents.
- **Inter-agent messaging** delivered at the recipient's next turn.
- **Live event streams** and a TUI dashboard for humans watching multiple agents at once.

One deliberate design choice: Yggdrasil is **global per user**, not per repo. One Postgres instance backs every repo you work in; agents are auto-keyed by the basename of the current working directory. The trade-off is documented in [ADR 0008](docs/adr/0008-shared-db-across-repos.md) and [Open questions](docs/open-questions.md).
